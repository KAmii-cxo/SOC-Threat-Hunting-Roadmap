# SOC Analyst Threat Hunting Career Roadmap

I am interested in SOC roles in cybersecurity. This roadmap is designed to guide me and other aspiring SOC Analysts through the essential knowledge, tools, and methodologies for a successful career in threat hunting. 

---

## 1. Strengthen Core Knowledge
- **Security Fundamentals**: Understand key concepts like the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), encryption, firewalls, IDS/IPS, etc.
- **Incident Response**: Learn how SOCs handle incidents, including detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Familiarize yourself with tools and sources like MISP, OpenIOC, and STIX/TAXII.
- **Log Analysis**: Practice parsing and analyzing logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, servers, and endpoints.

---

## 2. Tools & Technologies
- **SIEM Systems**: Learn to use Security Information and Event Management tools like Splunk and ELK for log aggregation and correlation.
- **EDR Tools**: Get hands-on experience with endpoint detection tools (e.g., Carbon Black, CrowdStrike, Cortex XDR).
- **Threat Hunting Platforms**: Explore tools like TheHive and Cortex for workflow automation.
- **Network Analysis Tools**: Develop skills in analyzing network traffic using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.

---

## 3. Threat Hunting Methodologies
- **Hypothesis-Driven Hunting**: Formulate hypotheses based on known threats and behavioral indicators.
- **TTPs**: Study the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to understand adversary tactics and techniques.
- **IOC & IOA Detection**: Learn to identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Attack (IOAs).

---

## 4. Build a Threat Hunting Lab
- **Virtualized Lab**: Set up virtual machines (VMs) to simulate real-world networks and endpoints.
- **Simulate Attacks**: Use tools like Metasploit and Cuckoo Sandbox to simulate attacks.
- **Log & Network Analysis**: Capture and analyze logs and network traffic in your lab.

---

## 5. Develop Soft Skills
- **Communication**: Master clear reporting for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Collaboration**: Work effectively with SOC teams and other cybersecurity professionals.
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies.

---

## 6. Get Certifications
- CompTIA Security+
- Certified SOC Analyst (CSA)
- GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI)
- Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
- Splunk Certified Power User

---

## 7. Gain Hands-On Experience
- **Internships & Junior Roles**: Start in SOC analyst internships or entry-level positions.
- **CTFs**: Participate in Capture the Flag challenges to improve your skills.
- **Communities**: Join forums like Redditâ€™s r/cybersecurity, Stack Exchange, or Discord groups.

---

## 8. Build a Portfolio
- **Documentation & Reports**: Share detailed case studies and reports.
- **Lab Projects**: Showcase your labs on GitHub.
- **Blogging**: Write about your journey, techniques, and lessons learned.
